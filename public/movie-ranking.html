<h1>My Movie Ratings : H.D.Hawkins </h1>
<h2>My 3 all time favourite movies or TV show</h2>

<hr />

<h3>White Collar</h3>
<p>Most suspensful and seat holding series. Love all the characters and well thought out story plot. <br />
Show finishes with a BIGGG Bang</p>

<h3>Instant Family</h3>
<p> I love the how real the movie is and how so many people can actually relate to the story line and the hardship of infertility and the adoption process.</p>

<h3>How to Train your Dragon</h3>
<p>All time favourite cartoon. Love the story line and the development of the relationship between toothless and hiccup. Can watch it over and over again! </p>
